## Honeypot Deployed

Dionaea
  
## Issues Encountered

The only major issue encoured was during the exportation of the session.json file. The provided instructions for the exportation of the   file return an error. I believe that the cause of this issue was my Windows operationg system. Additional research had to be made in order to export the session.json file. 
  
## Summary of Data Collected

I deployed two Dionaea honeypots. Between the two, they experienced over 10,503 attacks in the first hour of deployment. The attacks came to a crawl after several hours of deployment. Attacks came from all over the world. However, the majority of the attacks came from the United States. Out of 10,503 attacks, 9,011 attacks originated in the United States. The most attacked port was 5060 with 656 attacks.
